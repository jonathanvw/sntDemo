# sntDemo
Demo for SNT Widget

Built this responsive widget using meteor,bootstrap less, and a free geo ip API service: ip-api.com

You can run the app locally with meteor.js.  Just download this repo, cd into this project and type "meteor" in your terminal.

Even easier than that... you can go to a live deployment of it here: http://sntdemojav.meteor.com/

The code has some rough edges here and there, but its got a good start.
